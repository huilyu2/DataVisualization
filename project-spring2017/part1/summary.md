I once made data analysis and visualization on the Champaign-Urbana-MTD Bus Transportation Dataset. 

My goal was to statistically analyze and visualize how bus stops are distributed on the map, what are the stops densities in different areas, how quickly buses of different routes go at various time in different locations, and how trips of each route correlate with stops densities. I first wrote some SQL queries to preprocess the original text files into ordered and structured CSV files, of about 3000 entries and 50 attributes. The problems I encountered were (1) data with N/A value or missing data (2) strong class imbalance of data for some attributes (3) what types of figures or diagrams I could use to better visualize the results for different research questions. To solve the problems, I firstly cleaned the data in Python, and then built "foreign key" relations between multiple CSV files, sorted the data based on some attributes before plotting figures, computed statistical parameters and did linear regressions. I used scatter plots with a map to answer stops related questions, histograms to answer numerical trips and routes questions, line graphs to answer bus speed questions. 

My work is a part of the whole team project. Our final report can be found in the GitHub repository: https://github.com/huilyu2/DataVisualization/tree/master/project-spring2017/part1
